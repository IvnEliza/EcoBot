# Our Mission

This bot is here to help you identify packaging types and make waste disposal simple, accurate, and hassle-free. Let‚Äôs work together to keep the planet cleaner!

# How to Use

Using the bot is easy:
1. Snap a photo of a product‚Äôs barcode.
2. Send it to the [bot](https://t.me/eco_assist_bot).

The bot will analyze the packaging type and provide tailored guidance on how to dispose of it responsibly.

We use the **Open Food Facts database**, which focuses on food products. Currently, this means the bot works **only with food packaging** (see the full list of supported products [here](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)). Keep in mind:
* Not all products in the database include detailed packaging info. However, the bot already supports **100,000+ products** and is growing!
* Response times can vary depending on server load, taking up to **a couple of minutes**.

Rest assured, we **do not store your data or media files**. Images are deleted when removed from the chat, ensuring your privacy.

# Earn Rewards!

Every time you submit a product‚Äôs barcode and follow the disposal recommendations:
* Earn **five virtual caps** for each material you recycle correctly.
* Earn **ten caps** for single-material packaging.

Collect **1,000 caps** to claim a fun prize: a themed sticker set! Buttons will appear below the recommendation message to claim your caps.

# Contribute to the Cause

You can help us ‚Äî and the **Open Food Facts** project ‚Äî by enriching the database:
* Download the Open Food Facts app from their [official website](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-mobile-app).
* Add new products or enhance existing product descriptions to improve packaging details.

Your contributions will make the bot even smarter and more accurate!
