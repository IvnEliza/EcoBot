1. *Identify C/PAP Waste*🔍
   • C/PAP (Composite Paper-Plastic) items include packaging like drink cartons, paper cups with plastic linings, or food containers.  

2. *Check Local Guidelines*🚮
   • Not all recycling facilities accept C/PAP materials. Confirm if they can be recycled in your area or if special drop-off locations are required.  

3. *Clean and Dry*💧
   • Rinse items to remove food or liquid residue, and let them dry before disposal.  

4. *Separate Non-Recyclable Components*↪
   • Remove caps, plastic lids, or labels, and recycle them separately if possible.  

5. *Avoid Non-Recyclable C/PAP*❗
   • Do NOT recycle heavily soiled, greasy, or non-certified compostable C/PAP items.
