1. *Identify HDPE Items*🔍
   • Look for the #2 recycling symbol. Common examples are milk jugs, detergent bottles, shampoo bottles, and some grocery bags.

2. *Clean and Dry*💧
   • Rinse items to remove any food, liquid, or residue.

3. *Remove Non-HDPE Parts*↪
   • Take off caps, labels, and other materials unless they are also HDPE.

4. *Avoid Non-Recyclable HDPE*❗
   • Do NOT recycle:
     ◦ HDPE items contaminated with grease or heavy dirt.
     ◦ Mixed-material products (e.g., multi-layered containers).

5. *Flatten Containers (If Allowed)*🔄
   • Flatten bottles and containers to save space, but check local guidelines first.
