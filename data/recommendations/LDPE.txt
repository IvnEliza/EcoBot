1. *Identify LDPE Items*🔍
   • Look for the #4 recycling symbol. Common examples are plastic bags, cling wraps, squeeze bottles, and some packaging films.

2. *Clean and Dry*💧
   • Rinse items to remove food, grease, or liquid residue.

3. *Separate LDPE from Other Plastics*↪
   • Keep LDPE waste distinct from harder plastics like PET or HDPE.

4. *Avoid Non-Recyclable LDPE*❗
   • Do NOT recycle:
     ◦ Dirty or greasy LDPE items.
     ◦ Multi-material films (e.g., foil-lined or laminated plastics).

5. *Special Instructions for Bags and Wraps*❕
   • Take LDPE bags and films to designated drop-off points; they are rarely accepted in curbside bins.
