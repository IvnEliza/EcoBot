1. *Identify Composite Waste*🔍
   • Composite items are made of mixed materials (e.g., Tetra Paks, juice cartons, coffee cups, or foil-lined packaging).

2. *Check Local Guidelines*🚮
   • Not all facilities accept composite materials. Confirm if they are recyclable in your area and how they should be sorted.

3. *Clean and Dry*💧
   • Rinse to remove food or liquid residue before recycling.

4. *Separate Components (If Possible)*↪
   • Remove caps, straws, or liners from composite items and sort separately if recyclable.

5. *Avoid Non-Recyclable Items*❗
   • Do NOT recycle heavily contaminated or unrecyclable composites (e.g., certain multi-layered plastics).
