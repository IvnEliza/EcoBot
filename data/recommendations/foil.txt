1. *Identify Aluminum Foil*🔍
   • Only recycle clean, non-laminated aluminum foil. Common examples are kitchen foil and foil food trays.

2. *Clean and Dry*💧
   • Remove food residue; rinse and dry foil before recycling.

3. *Flatten and Compress*🔄
   • Ball up small foil pieces together to prevent them from getting lost in the recycling process.

4. *Avoid Non-Recyclable Foil*❗
   • Do NOT recycle:
     ◦ Foil that is greasy or heavily soiled.
     ◦ Laminated or mixed-material foil (e.g., chip bags, foil-lined paper).

5. *Check Local Guidelines*🚮
   • Some facilities may require foil to be taken to special recycling centers.
