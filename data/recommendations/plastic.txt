1. *Check Plastic Type* 🔍
   • Look for the recycling symbol with a number (1–7) on the item.
   • Most facilities accept #1 (PET) and #2 (HDPE) plastics; check local rules for other types.

2. *Clean and Dry*💧
   • Rinse items to remove food or liquid residue. Dirty plastics can contaminate recycling.

3. *Separate Non-Recyclables*❗
   • Do NOT recycle:
     ◦ Plastic bags and cling wrap (take to special drop-off points).
     ◦ Styrofoam (unless explicitly accepted).
     ◦ Dirty or greasy items (e.g., food containers).

4. *Avoid Mixing Materials*❗
   • Remove labels, caps, or other materials not made of the same plastic type.

5. *Flatten Bottles*🔄
   • Flatten bottles to save space, but keep caps off unless your facility specifies otherwise.
