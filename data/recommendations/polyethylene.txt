1. *Identify Polyethylene Types*🔍
   • Common forms include:
     ◦ HDPE (#2): Milk jugs, detergent bottles.
     ◦ LDPE (#4): Plastic bags, wrap, and some squeezable bottles.

2. *Clean and Dry*💧
   • Rinse polyethylene items to remove any food or liquid residue.

3. *Separate by Type (If Required)*❕
   • Keep HDPE and LDPE items separate if your local facility requires it.

4. *Avoid Non-Recyclable Polyethylene*❗
   • Do NOT recycle:
     ◦ Items with mixed materials (e.g., foil-lined plastics).
     ◦ Dirty or heavily stained plastics.

5. *Special Instructions for Bags and Wrap*❕
   • Take plastic bags, wraps, and films to designated drop-off points — these are rarely accepted in curbside recycling.
